title: Non-thermal Emission in Sagittarius B?
title_detail: Non-thermal Emission in Sagittarius B?

We summarize three recent publications which suggest that the Galactic center
region Sagittarius B (Sgr B) may contain non-thermal radio components (Crocker
et al. 2007, Hollis et al. 2007 and Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007a). Based on new VLA
matched-resolution continuum data at 327 MHz and 1.4 GHz, we find no evidence
for large scale non-thermal radio emission at these frequencies; the spectral
behavior is likely determined by the complex summation of multiple HII region
components with a wide range of emission measures and hence radio turn-over
frequencies. Also, we discuss a possible additional interpretation of the radio
continuum spectrum of individual component Sgr B2-F carried out by Yusef-Zadeh
et al; confusion from nearby HII components with widely different turn-over
frequencies may contribute to the the change in slope of the radio continuum in
this direction at low frequencies. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties in the
determination of the spectral index of the GBT continuum data of Sgr B carried
out by Hollis et al. We find that the apparent spectral index determined by
their procedure is also likely due to a summation over the many diverse thermal
components in this direction.
